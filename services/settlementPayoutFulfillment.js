   SETTLEMENT PAYOUT FULFILLMENT
   The one place that actually marks a PartnerSettlement "paid" and
   cascades the side effects (PartnerCommission rows -> "settled",
   Partner.stats, activity log, notification) — shared by both payment
   paths in adminSettlementController (offline, Razorpay-verify). Keeping
   this in one place is what guarantees the cascade can't drift between
   paths.

   payable.total (net + GST, if a verified bill exists) is what actually
   gets recorded as paid — see adminSettlementController.computePayableAmount.
