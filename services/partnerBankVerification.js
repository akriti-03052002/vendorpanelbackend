/* ============================================================
   PARTNER BANK VERIFICATION — ₹1 CHECKOUT PAYMENT
   Shared between partnerBankController.confirmBankVerification (the
   browser calling back right after Razorpay Checkout succeeds) and
   razorpayWebhookController (the payment.captured safety net) — same
   "verify twice, apply once, idempotently" shape as
   services/customerPaymentFulfillment.js.

   Test-mode Checkout can't hand back a real bank account number/IFSC to
   cross-check (that needs RazorpayX Fund Account Validation, a separate
   product this app doesn't use in dev) — the closest signal available is
   which bank a netbanking test payment went through
   (`payment.bank`), which is compared against the bank name the partner
   typed. Any other method (UPI/card/wallet) can't be matched
   automatically at all — flagged `unverifiable` rather than guessed at,
   left for an admin to check by hand (see adminBankController
   .verifyBankAccount's override path).
