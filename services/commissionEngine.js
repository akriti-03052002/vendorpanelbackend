   COMMISSION ENGINE
   Runs whenever a customer's subscription payment is confirmed. Picks
   the partner's active custom CommissionRule assignment if one exists,
   falling back to the generic active CommissionRule, computes the
   commission, writes the ledger row, and bumps the partner's cached
   stats.

   One payment shape needs special handling here:
   - Optional recurring add-on: a SECOND rule (CommissionRule.isAddOn =
     true, scoped by partnerType) that the admin chooses to apply
     per-deal, not something that fires automatically.

   KNOWN LIMITATION: for commissionType starting with "recurring_",
   this only creates the FIRST cycle. There's no scheduler yet to
   auto-generate renewal cycles (cycleNumber 2, 3, ...) — that
   would need a cron job, which is out of scope for this pass.

   Vendor-only path: fires whenever a Customer's subscription is
   paid — either an admin marking it via adminCustomerController.
   markCustomerPaid, or the customer's own Razorpay checkout (see

   adminUser is undefined there since no admin is involved). This is the "core

   of subscription per active screen — but since there's no

   rather than an automatic renewal. cycleNumber counts prior
   commissions against this customer so recurring rules read
