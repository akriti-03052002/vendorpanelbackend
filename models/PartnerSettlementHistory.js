/* ============================================================
   PARTNER SETTLEMENT HISTORY
   Append-only audit trail — one row per event on a PartnerSettlement
   (created, approved, held, released, paid, failed, retried, bill
   submitted/verified/rejected). New model so PartnerSettlement itself
   never needs a "history" array or any other edit; this just references
   it by settlementId, same pattern as PartnerSettlementBill.

   Kept separate from PartnerActivity (which is partner-facing, general-
   purpose, and has a fixed activityType enum that doesn't cover every
   settlement-specific event) so the settlement timeline can show its own
   precise action names and structured before/after snapshots without
   fighting that enum.
