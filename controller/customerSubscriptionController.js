/* ============================================================
   CUSTOMER — SUBSCRIPTION (SELF-SERVICE CHECKOUT)
   Customer picks a plan, screen count, and a prepaid term length
   (1/3/6/12 months — SUBSCRIPTION_DURATIONS). If anything is owed,
   GST is added on top of the base amount and a Razorpay Order is
   created for the GST-inclusive total; the frontend opens Razorpay's
   own Checkout popup against that order, where the customer picks
   UPI/card/netbanking/etc themselves. Nothing is activated off the
   client's word alone — the popup's result is verified two
   independent ways (HMAC signature, then a fetchPaymentById
   re-check that it's actually captured for the right amount) before
   the subscription change and partner commission are applied, via
   the shared services/customerPaymentFulfillment. A $0 change (e.g.
   a deferred downgrade, or a same-cost lateral change) skips
   Razorpay entirely.

   Billing cycle / proration: a subscription runs on a
   (durationMonths × 30-day) currentPeriodStart -> currentPeriodEnd
   window.
   - Upgrade (or same-cost lateral change) mid-cycle AT THE SAME
     durationMonths: applies right away, charging only the prorated
     difference for the days left in the window — the window itself
     does NOT reset.
   - Downgrade mid-cycle AT THE SAME durationMonths: does NOT apply
     right away. They already paid for the pricier plan this cycle,
     so they keep it (and aren't charged anything more) until
     currentPeriodEnd, at which point the downgrade takes effect —
     see scheduledChange below.
   - Picking a DIFFERENT durationMonths than what's currently active
     is always treated as starting a fresh prepaid term right now —
     full price for the newly chosen term, window resets from today.
     Keeps the proration math from having to reconcile two
     differently-sized windows; no credit for unused time either way,
     same "no refund" spirit as a same-duration downgrade.
   - A change requested once the window has lapsed is charged in
     full and opens a fresh window.

   There's no scheduler to auto-renew or auto-apply a scheduled
   downgrade at currentPeriodEnd; materializeScheduledChangeIfDue
   applies it lazily the next time the customer's subscription is
   touched (viewed or changed) on or after that date — same "lazy,
   no cron" spirit as everything else in this billing flow.
